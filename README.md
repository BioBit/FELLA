Heat diffusion on biological graphs

This repository contains the FELLA package. FELLA is a Metabolomics data enrichment tool that contextualises the experimental results using KEGG reactions, enzymes, modules and pathways. The layout of the analysis is in a human-readable fashion, exportable to several formats, containing a biological interpetation of the experiment. The input for our package is a list of affected metabolites between experimental conditions. 

To use this package type in your terminal: 

R CMD build FELLA

R CMD INSTALL FELLA
